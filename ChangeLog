2008-09-04: Version 0.3.0

        Added support for running tests on the ARM simulator.

        Fixed bug in the 'in' operator where negative indices were not
        treated correctly.

        Fixed build issues on gcc-4.3.1.

        Changed Date.prototype.toLocaleTimeString to not print the
        timezone part of the time.

        Renamed debug.h to v8-debug.h to reduce the risk of name conflicts
        with user code.


2008-09-02: Version 0.2.5

        Renamed the top level directory 'public' to 'include'.

        Added 'env' option to the SCons build scripts to support
        overriding the ENV part of the build environment.  This is mostly
        to support Windows builds in cases where SCons cannot find the
        correct paths to the Windows SDK, as these paths cannot be passed
        through shell environment variables.

        Enabled "Buffer Security Check" on for the Windows SCons build and
        added the linker option /OPT:ICF as an optimization.

        Added the V8 benchmark suite to the repository.


2008-09-01: Version 0.2.4

        Included mjsunit JavaScript test suite and C++ unit tests.

        Changed the shell sample to not print the result of executing a
        script provided on the command line.

        Fixed issue when building samples on Windows using a shared V8
        library.  Added visibility option on Linux build which makes the
        generated library 18% smaller.

        Changed build system to accept multiple build modes in one build
        and generate separate objects, libraries and executables for each
        mode.

        Removed deferred negation optimization (a * -b => -(a * b)) since
        this visibly changes operand conversion order.

        Improved parsing performance by introducing stack guard in
        preparsing.  Without a stack guard preparsing always bails out
        with stack overflow.

        Changed shell sample to take flags directly from the command-line.
        Added API call that implements this.

        Added load, quit and version functions to the shell sample so it's
        easier to run benchmarks and tests.

        Fixed issue with building samples and cctests on 64-bit machines.

        Fixed bug in the runtime system where the prototype chain was not
        always searched for a setter when setting a property that does not
        exist locally.
        

2008-08-14: Version 0.2.3

        Improved performance of garbage collection by moving the
        function that updates pointers during compacting collection
        into the updating visitor.  This gives the compiler a better
        chance to inline and avoid a function call per (potential)
        pointer.

        Extended the shell sample with a --runtime-flags option.

        Added Visual Studio project files for the shell.cc and
        process.cc samples.


2008-08-13: Version 0.2.2

        Improved performance of garbage collection by changing the way
        we use the marking stack in the event of stack overflow during
        full garbage collection and by changing the way we mark roots.

        Cleaned up ARM version by removing top of stack caching and by
        introducing push/pop elimination.

        Cleaned up the way runtime functions are called to allow
        runtime calls with no arguments.

        Changed Windows build options to make sure that exceptions are
        disabled and that optimization flags are enabled.

        Added first version of Visual Studio project files.


2008-08-06: Version 0.2.1

        Improved performance of unary addition by avoiding runtime calls.

        Fixed the handling of '>' and '<=' to use right-to-left conversion
        and left-to-right evaluation as specified by ECMA-262.

        Fixed a branch elimination bug on the ARM platform where incorrect
        code was generated because of overly aggressive branch
        elimination.

        Improved performance of code that repeatedly assigns the same
        function to the same property of different objects with the same
        map.

        Untangled DEBUG and ENABLE_DISASSEMBLER defines.  The disassembler
        no longer expects DEBUG to be defined.

        Added platform-nullos.cc to serve as the basis for new platform
        implementations.


2008-07-30: Version 0.2.0

        Changed all text files to have native svn:eol-style.

        Added a few samples and support for building them. The samples
        include a simple shell that can be used to benchmark and test V8.

        Changed V8::GetVersion to return the version as a string.

        Added source for lazily loaded scripts to snapshots and made
        serialization non-destructive.

        Improved ARM support by fixing the write barrier code to use
        aligned loads and stores and by removing premature locals
        optimization that relied on broken support for callee-saved
        registers (removed).

        Refactored the code for marking live objects during garbage
        collection and the code for allocating objects in paged
        spaces. Introduced an abstraction for the map word of a heap-
        allocated object and changed the memory allocator to allocate
        executable memory only for spaces that may contain code objects.

        Moved StringBuilder to utils.h and ScopedLock to platform.h, where
        they can be used by debugging and logging modules. Added
        thread-safe message queues for dealing with debugger events.

        Fixed the source code reported by toString for certain builtin
        empty functions and made sure that the prototype property of a
        function is enumerable.

        Improved performance of converting values to condition flags in
        generated code.

        Merged disassembler-{arch} files.


2008-07-28: Version 0.1.4

        Added support for storing JavaScript stack traces in a stack
        allocated buffer to make it visible in shallow core dumps.
        Controlled by the --preallocate-message-memory flag which is
        disabled by default.


2008-07-25: Version 0.1.3

        Fixed bug in JSObject::GetPropertyAttributePostInterceptor where
        map transitions would count as properties.

        Allowed aliased eval invocations by treating them as evals in the
        global context. This may change in the future.

        Added support for accessing the last entered context through the
        API and renamed Context::Current to Context::GetCurrent and
        Context::GetSecurityContext to Context::GetCurrentSecurityContext.

        Fixed bug in the debugger that would cause the debugger scripts to
        be recursively loaded and changed all disabling of interrupts to
        be block-structured.

        Made snapshot data read-only to allow it to be more easily shared
        across multiple users of V8 when linked as a shared library.


2008-07-16: Version 0.1.2

        Fixed building on Mac OS X by recognizing i386 and friends as
        IA-32 platforms.

        Added propagation of stack overflow exceptions that occur while
        compiling nested functions.

        Improved debugger with support for recursive break points and
        handling of exceptions that occur in the debugger JavaScript code.

        Renamed GetInternal to GetInternalField and SetInternal to
        SetInternalField in the API and moved InternalFieldCount and
        SetInternalFieldCount from FunctionTemplate to ObjectTemplate.


2008-07-09: Version 0.1.1

        Fixed bug in stack overflow check code for IA-32 targets where a
        non-tagged value in register eax was pushed to the stack.

        Fixed potential quadratic behavior when converting strings to
        numbers.

        Fixed bug where the return value from Object::SetProperty could
        end up being the property holder instead of the written value.

        Improved debugger support by allowing nested break points and by
        dealing with stack-overflows when compiling functions before
        setting break points in them.


2008-07-03: Version 0.1.0

        Initial export.
