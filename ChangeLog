2008-08-06: Version 0.2.1 (130029)

        Improved performance of unary addition by avoiding runtime calls.

        Fixed the handling of '>' and '<=' to use right-to-left conversion
        and left-to-right evaluation as specified by ECMA-262.

        Fixed a branch elimination bug on the ARM platform where incorrect
        code was generated because of overly aggressive branch
        elimination.

        Improved performance of code that repeatedly assigns the same
        function to the same property of different objects with the same
        map.

        Untangled DEBUG and ENABLE_DISASSEMBLER defines.  The disassembler
        no longer expects DEBUG to be defined.

        Added platform-nullos.cc to serve as the basis for new platform
        implementations.

        
2008-07-30: Version 0.2.0 (129146)

        Changed all text files to have native svn:eol-style.

        Added a few samples and support for building them. The samples
        include a simple shell that can be used to benchmark and test V8.

        Changed V8::GetVersion to return the version as a string.

        Added source for lazily loaded scripts to snapshots and made
        serialization non-destructive.

        Improved ARM support by fixing the write barrier code to use
        aligned loads and stores and by removing premature locals
        optimization that relied on broken support for callee-saved
        registers (removed).

        Refactored the code for marking live objects during garbage
        collection and the code for allocating objects in paged
        spaces. Introduced an abstraction for the map word of a heap-
        allocated object and changed the memory allocator to allocate
        executable memory only for spaces that may contain code objects.

        Moved StringBuilder to utils.h and ScopedLock to platform.h, where
        they can be used by debugging and logging modules. Added
        thread-safe message queues for dealing with debugger events.

        Fixed the source code reported by toString for certain builtin
        empty functions and made sure that the prototype property of a
        function is enumerable.

        Improved performance of converting values to condition flags in
        generated code.

        Merged disassembler-{arch} files.


2008-07-28: Version 0.1.4 (128918)

        Added support for storing JavaScript stack traces in a stack
        allocated buffer to make it visible in shallow core dumps.
        Controlled by the --preallocate-message-memory flag which is
        disabled by default.


2008-07-25: Version 0.1.3 (128832)

        Fixed bug in JSObject::GetPropertyAttributePostInterceptor where
        map transitions would count as properties.

        Allowed aliased eval invocations by treating them as evals in the
        global context. This may change in the future.

        Added support for accessing the last entered context through the
        API and renamed Context::Current to Context::GetCurrent and
        Context::GetSecurityContext to Context::GetCurrentSecurityContext.

        Fixed bug in the debugger that would cause the debugger scripts to
        be recursively loaded and changed all disabling of interrupts to
        be block-structured.

        Made snapshot data read-only to allow it to be more easily shared
        across multiple users of V8 when linked as a shared library.


2008-07-16: Version 0.1.2 (127441)

        Fixed building on Mac OS X by recognizing i386 and friends as
        IA-32 platforms.

        Added propagation of stack overflow exceptions that occur while
        compiling nested functions.

        Improved debugger with support for recursive break points and
        handling of exceptions that occur in the debugger JavaScript code.

        Renamed GetInternal to GetInternalField and SetInternal to
        SetInternalField in the API and moved InternalFieldCount and
        SetInternalFieldCount from FunctionTemplate to ObjectTemplate.


2008-07-09: Version 0.1.1 (126448)

        Fixed bug in stack overflow check code for IA-32 targets where a
        non-tagged value in register eax was pushed to the stack.

        Fixed potential quadratic behavior when converting strings to
        numbers.

        Fixed bug where the return value from Object::SetProperty could
        end up being the property holder instead of the written value.

        Improved debugger support by allowing nested break points and by
        dealing with stack-overflows when compiling functions before
        setting break points in them.


2008-07-03: Version 0.1.0 (125876)

        Initial export.
