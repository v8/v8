/* This is JavaScriptCore's variant of the PCRE library. While this library
started out as a copy of PCRE, many of the features of PCRE have been
removed. This library now supports only the regular expression features
required by the JavaScript language specification, and has only the functions
needed by JavaScriptCore and the rest of WebKit.
